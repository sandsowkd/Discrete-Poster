  \begin{block}{Abstract}
    \large The Rubik's Cube, an iconic 3D puzzle, has captured the imagination of enthusiasts and mathematicians 
    alike for decades. This poster delves into the mathematical intricacies of the Rubik's Cube. We investigate the 
    cube's symmetry, its staggering number of possible permutations, and the use of computer aided proofs to 
    calculate the algorithms to solve the Rubik's Cube. %Whether you're a puzzle enthusiast or a math fanatic, this poster 
    %invites you to embark on a fascinating journey into the world of Rubik's Cube mathematics.

  \begin{block}{Combinations of a Rubik's Cube}

    \large There are three visible types of pieces:

    \begin{itemize} %Talk about centers/edges/corners
      \item \textbf{Corners:} 8 of these on each corner of the cube
      \item \textbf{Edges:} 12 of these connecting adjacent corners
      \item \textbf{Centers:} 6 of these on each face of the cube
    \end{itemize}

    Permutations on the Rubik's Cube: 

    \begin{itemize} %Talk about centers/edges/corners
      \item \textbf{8!} ways to permute corner pieces into their slots
      \item \textbf{12!} ways to permute edge pieces into their slots
      \item $\mathbf{3^8}$ ways to orient each corner piece
      \item $\mathbf{2^{12}}$ ways to orient each edge piece
    \end{itemize}
    We also have to divide by $12$, since some states are impossible. \\

    $$ \displaystyle\frac{8!\cdot 12! \cdot 3^8 \cdot 2^{12}}{12} = 43252003274489856000 $$ \\

  \begin{block}{How big is 43 Quintillion?}

    \large 
    %Imagine we find a new, unique Rubik's cube combination every second. There are
    %about 31 million seconds in a year, so it would take more than 1.3 trillion years. \\
    %Imagine we started doing this during the Dinosaur Age: we would only get to 2 quadrillion combinations. \\
    %We would have to repeat the process more than 20,000 times to reach all 43 quintillion combinations! \\
    %Imagine we had a dollar for each rubik's cube combination there was. If were to lay one layer of one dollar bills in
    %Colorado, it would take 25 trillion dollars. We would have to stack that another 2 million times to use all of our money. \\
    %The stack would be about the same height of the tallest building in Denver. In other words,
    %the money would cover all of Colorado in a layer as tall as a skyscraper.

    Imagine 43 Quintillion Dollar bills:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item One layer of bills over all of Colorado costs \$ 25 trillion
      \item One stack of bills 800 feet tall costs \$ 2 million
    \end{itemize}

    Combined, it will cost about \$ 43 Quintillion

  \begin{block}{Solving a Rubik's Cube}

    
    \large A popular method for speed-solving is CFOP where you create a Center \textbf{Cross}, solve the 
    First two layers(\textbf{F2L}), Orient the last layer(\textbf{OLL}), and Permute the last layer(\textbf{PLL}). 
   Maximum turns for each step: 

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[\textbf{C}] Center Cross - 8 moves
      \item[\textbf{F}] First 2 Layers(F2L) - 28 moves
      \item[\textbf{O}] Orientation of Last Layer(OLL) - 11 moves
      \item[\textbf{P}] Permutation of Last Layer(PLL) - 14 moves
    \end{enumerate}

    Across the four steps in CFOP we have about 60 moves needed to solve a 3x3 Cube.

  \begin{block}{Other Computer Aided Proofs}

    %\large Obviously, it would be impossible for humans to go through all 43 Quintillion
    %combinations of a Rubik's cube. However, computers have been able to use exhaustive search
    %and other techniques to determine God's number. Other proofs that have used computers include:
    
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Connect Four:} Always win for first player
      \item \textbf{Sudoku:} You need at least 12 clues to solve a Sudoku Puzzle
      \item \textbf{Chess:} Analyzing Endgames
      \item \textbf{Chopsticks:} Always draw if played perfectly
      \item \textbf{Kepler's Conjecture:} Optimal sphere-packing in 3 Dimensions
      \item \textbf{Four Color Theorem:} Proved the conjecture

  \begin{block}{Applications to Speed Cubing}

    %\large There are many different methods for Speed Cubing, all aimed at Solving
    %the cube as fast as possible. This involves coming up with ways to use
    %less moves and using easily executed algorithms. Here are a couple:

    \large \textbf{Speedcubing:} Solving scrambled Rubik's cube as fast as possible

    \begin{center}
      \textbf{Table of different solving methods}
    \end{center}
    \begin{table}
      \centering
      \begin{tabular}{l r r c}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Method} & \textbf{\# Turns} & \textbf{\# Algorithms} & \textbf{Average Times (s)} \\
        \midrule
        Beginner & 80-100 & 15 & 30-120 \\
        CFOP & 55-60 & 78 & 5-30 \\
        Roux & 45-50 & 100+ & 5-20 \\
        ZZ & 45-55 & 493 & 5-15 \\
        \bottomrule
      \end{tabular}
    \end{table}


  As more methods and algorithms get developed with the aid of computers,
  speed-cube times have been getting lower considerably:

  \begin{block}{What about larger Rubik's Cubes?}
    
    \large The number of possible combinations of larger Rubik's Cube scale exponentially \\
    
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{4x4:} 7.4 quattuordecillion ($7.5\cdot 10^{45}$) - 20s solve time
      \item \textbf{5x5:} 283 trevigintillion ($283 \cdot 10^{72}$) - 38s solve time
      \item \textbf{6x6:} Big number with 117 digits - 75s solve time
      \item \textbf{7x7:} Big number with 165 digits - 110s solve time
    \end{itemize}

    The general formula for the combinations on an $n \times n$ cube is: \\

    $$ \displaystyle 7! \cdot  3^6 \left( 24 \cdot 2^{10} \cdot 12!  \right)^{n \text{ mod} 2}
    (24!)^{\lfloor \frac{n-2}{2} \rfloor} \left( \displaystyle\frac{24!}{4!^{6}} 
    \right)^{\lfloor \left( \frac{n-2}{2} \right)^2 \rfloor} $$ \\
